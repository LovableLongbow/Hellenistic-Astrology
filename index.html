      <h1>Introduction to Hellenistic Astrology</h1>
      <p>
        Hellenistic astrology is the earliest systematic form of Western astrology, developed between the 2nd century BCE and the 6th century CE. Drawing from a synthesis of Babylonian astronomical techniques and Greek philosophical frameworks, it represents a structured approach to interpreting celestial phenomena in relation to human life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tradition emphasizes concepts such as fate, fortune, and character through defined techniques including the use of whole sign houses, planetary sect, and time-lord systems. This site aims to present the foundational theories and methodologies of Hellenistic astrology within their historical and philosophical context.

      <h2>About the Practitioner</h2>
      <p>
        With over five years of focused study in astrology, my work centers on the techniques and philosophy of the Hellenistic tradition. I have interpreted hundreds of charts—ranging from natal and electional to financial astrology—applying time-tested methods such as whole sign houses, planetary sect, profections, and zodiacal releasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach is rooted in close reading of historical texts and a disciplined practice of traditional techniques. This site serves as a resource for those interested in exploring the intellectual and practical richness of classical astrology through a historically informed lens.
